## Notes
* You'll need `ipyevents` and `ipywidgets`
* `nodejs` I think is a prereq for `ipywidgets` so that should be fine. I don't use it directly but it is in the `environment.yml`
* Conda should be able to handle everything else. `pytesseract` should be ok, but it has been problematic in the past, maybe only if `Tesseract` is installed separately??? Should be fine.
