# PDF Digitizer
Somewhat user-friendly tool to help parse out structured text from a pdf document

## Usage
[Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_My2JVHbknM&ab_channel=JoelS "Video Title")

## Notes
* `pytesseract` can be finnicky
* You'll need `ipyevents` and `ipywidgets`
* `nodejs` I think is a prereq for `ipywidgets` so that should be fine. I don't use it directly but it is in the `environment.yml`
